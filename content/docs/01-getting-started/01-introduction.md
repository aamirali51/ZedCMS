# Introduction to Zed CMS

Welcome to **Zed CMS**, the high-performance, event-driven content management system built for speed and simplicity.

## The Philosophy: "Zero Bloat"

Most CMS platforms today (like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla) carry decades of legacy code. They support PHP versions from 2010, rely on complicated database abstraction layers, and load thousands of files just to show a "Hello World" page.

Zed CMS takes a different approach:
*   **Micro-Kernel Architecture:** The core engine is less than 500 lines of code.
*   **Modern Stack:** Requires PHP 8.2+. No backward compatibility for ancient servers.
*   **Direct PDO:** No heavy ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) slowing down queries.
*   **JSON Content:** We store content in JSON generated by a React-based block editor, ensuring clean data portability.

## Who is this for?

*   **Developers** who hate digging through 10 layers of abstraction to change a menu item.
*   **Publishers** who want a writing experience that feels like Notion or Medium, not a 2005 word processor.
*   **Agencies** who need to build custom, high-performance websites for clients without the "Generic WordPress Theme" look.

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Core** | The `/core` directory. Contains the immutable engine (`App`, `Router`, `Database`, `Auth`, `Event`). |
| **Addon** | A PHP file in `/content/addons` that extends functionality. The Admin Panel itself is just an addon. |
| **Theme** | A folder in `/content/themes` that controls the frontend look. |
| **Block** | A unit of content (paragraph, heading, image) stored as a JSON object. |
| **Blueprint** | The `ZERO_BLUEPRINT.md` file that serves as the strict architectural specification. |
