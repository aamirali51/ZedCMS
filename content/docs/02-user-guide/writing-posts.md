# Writing Posts

The Zed Editor uses a **block-based** approach, similar to Notion or Gutenberg.

## Basic Usage

1.  **Headings**: Type `/h1` or `#` followed by a space.
2.  **Lists**: Type `-` or `1.` followed by a space.
3.  **Images**: Drag and drop images directly onto the canvas.

## Publishing Workflow

*   **Draft**: Content is saved but not visible to the public.
*   **Published**: Content is live at `/{slug}`.

> **Tip:** Use the "Quick Draft" widget on the dashboard to start writing instantly.

## Advanced Features

*   **Slash Commands**: Type `/` to see all available blocks.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Reorder blocks by dragging the handle on the left.
